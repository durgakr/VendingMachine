Design decisions:
1. .NET 4.6.1 is used
2. PIN number is not encrypted in this case,but will need to encrypt in real time.
3. Test coverage is not 100%
4. Vending machine "Vend" function only returns success or failure.

Assumption:
1. Some dependency injection container will be used for Vending.cs to work.
2. Vending machine has only one type of drink.
